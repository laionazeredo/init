## Professional Experience

![ALMA](logo_alma.png) 

### **ALMA Tech | Ad | Behavior**

Developer (2016 - )
I develop websites based on Wordpress Framework (runs about 40% of all the internet) and, more recently, I work with Django and React Frameworks too.

I deal with all the challenges of putting a project online, since acquiring domain, renting hosting (shared hosting or VPS), configuring Apache/Linux servers to run wordpress apps, designing and planing the project, managing the project with the client, in a Agile fashion (when the client understands it), delivering it and training the client.

I deal with back and frontend challenges, serving a whole solution for the client.

A typical client is a small entrepreneur, a content producer or an startup small team seeking for a MVP or landing page for a product.

Having a strong business and consulting background, one of my best skills is translating the tech slang for regular client language.

My regular stack can contain:
- Shared hosting or VPS
- Apache/Linux Server
- MySQL database
- Wordpress
- Woocommerce
- Python Django
- ReactJs
- Bootstrap and Bulma CSS Frameworks
