## About Me
I develop in NodeJS and Python environments. I am comfortable developing frontend, both with templates (via frameworks like Django and Flask in Python), as well as using modern reactive frameworks (like React in the Node environment).

I develop RESTful applications that communicate with different frontends through the exposure of API endpoints.

I got relevant experience in web development, with more than 3 years working in the development of landing page applications (static websites), e-commerces and marketplaces (mostly using the Wordpress framework), dealing directly with the client and developing end to end, since the configuration of the infrastructure environment with the hosting service provider, backend and frontend development. I have a portfolio of over 20 sites in production.

I am a fan of Agile development practices, like to use TDD whenever possible and convenient for the project.
I use versioning tools throughout the development cycle and I like Git Flow as a management methodology. I feel very comfortable with remote work.

I use automated testing frameworks like Mocha + Chai (in the Node world) and unittest and pytest (in the Python world). For integration tests, I usually call Cypress for help.

In databases field, I have experience with MySQL / MariaDB and MongoDB, and minor experience with PostgreSQL.

In addition to the experience in software development, I worked as a Business Analyst and Consultant for large corporations for 6 years, linked to Deloitte Consulting. I worked with clients like Petrobras and Vale and led teams of up to 5 members throughout the definition process until the final delivery of the project.

## Professional Experience

![ALMA](logo_alma.png) 

### **ALMA Tech | Ad | Behavior**

Developer (2016 - )
I develop websites based on Wordpress Framework (runs about 40% of all the internet) and, more recently, I work with Django and React Frameworks too.

I deal with all the challenges of putting a project online, since acquiring domain, renting hosting (shared hosting or VPS), configuring Apache/Linux servers to run wordpress apps, designing and planing the project, managing the project with the client, in a Agile fashion (when the client understands it), delivering it and training the client.

I deal with back and frontend challenges, serving a whole solution for the client.

A typical client is a small entrepreneur, a content producer or an startup small team seeking for a MVP or landing page for a product.

Having a strong business and consulting background, one of my best skills is translating the tech slang for regular client language.

My regular stack can contain:
- Shared hosting or VPS
- Apache/Linux Server
- MySQL database
- Wordpress
- Woocommerce
- Python Django
- ReactJs
- Bootstrap and Bulma CSS Frameworks
